                            Our aim is to build a multi-platform app that will track and monitor a person’s state of
                            being, in terms of anxiety, by using a scale of one to five.
                            The app will also include coping mechanisms and journal logs for you to keep track of your
                            progress. Doctors, counsellors, and peers can also access this data if needed with your
                            consent.

                            Apollo is the idea of building an application on a smartwatch (WearOS) which can be used on
                            Android smartphones and watches. This will help users to manage and subdue their anxieties
                            causing for an easier life day to day.

                            Why are we creating this app? Well, the reason is, that some of the team members families
                            and themselves, have suffered from mental health issues in the past and they didn't
                            get the help needed to improve their wellbeing. Using our experiences, we are trying to help
                            people going through similar situations to create a better place in our app.

                            We decided on the name “Apollo” due to Apollo being the patron God of light and healing; we
                            felt like this was very fitting to our ambitions with this
                            project as we aim to help, heal, and bring betterment to people suffering from mental
                            health. It’s important to us to do something about ongoing poor mental health,
                            especially in young people as 50% of young people establish mental health problems by the
                            age of 14 this can grow to 75% of young people establishing mental health problems by 24.
                            Research has also shown that 1 in 6 young people will have experienced an anxiety disorder
                            at some point in their lives, which for us is one too many.

                                            I'm Mikey and my role in this project is Head Coder. As I am the head of
                                            coding, I have to make sure that that everything required and needed around
                                            code is completed and is on time.
                                            I work very closely with my team because if there isn't any communication
                                            between us the app and website will not be created and cannot benefit our
                                            users. I chose to work on Apollo as I want to help my friends and family to
